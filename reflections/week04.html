    <h3>Week 04 Zen Garden Reflection</h3>

    <h4>1. What was the most impactful thing you learned this week and why do you think so?</h5>
    <p>The most impactful thing I learned was how to use @use and @include in SCSS. By having different pieces of the
        CSS separated by files, this makes it easier to find things easier afterwards if anything needs to be changed.
        When I learned last week that I could have variables in CSS it made my heart happy. However, I was even happier
        when I learned this week you can have a whole file dedicated to just variables and call it in. This level of
        organization may take time to put together, but it is very much worth the effort. In the future, much time can
        be saved. </p>

    <h4>2. What questions do you have about this week's chosen topic(s) and/or exercises?</h5>
    <p>Although learning @use and @include were the most impactful, I am having a rough time getting it to work on my
        editors or machine. For whatever reason my SASS through ruby will not recognize the @use or @include commands.
        Is there a fix for that? I looked everywhere online and cannot find a solution. This next week I plan on
        uninstalling everything and installing again. Hopefully, reinstalling everything will fix that issue. </p>

    <h4>3. Would you like specific feedback from your instructor? If so, what things would you like feedback on?</h5>
    <p>Next week I would like to have some feedback. This week as a group I feel we have a good idea/plan for the Zen
        Garden.</p>

    <h4>4. Where would you go next to learn more about this week's topic(s)? Give 2-3 links to resources that look
        promising to help answer the questions you indicated in the quiz question above.</h5>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sass/">https://www.w3schools.com/sass/</a> - Good for keeping up with the
        basics and building a strong foundation on SASS.</p>
    <p><a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/">https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/</a>
        - Documentation for the @use I have been trying to use to fix my above problem. </p>

    <h4>5. Did you participate with the class on Microsoft Teams or Slack? </h5>
    <p>Yes, I answered a couple of posts that people left with comments. I also posted my question above to the Teams
        General channel. Hopefully, someone is having a similar issue.</p>

    <h4>6. Please rate your success with learning and this weekâ€™s work on a scale of 1 to 4.</h5>
    <p>While I would say that I was successful with my group getting the style-guide and wireframes, I would rate myself
        a 3 since I have not been able to figure out why my @use and @include do not work.</p>
